# My solutions to S-99 #

S-99 is a collection of 99 Scala katas which can be found at [http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99].

I've put each solution in its own file as a Scala script. For the exercise's sake, in some of the katas I've elected to not use most Scala built-in functions, implementing the solution mostly from scratch.
